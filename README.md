## Overview



## How to use

### Spotify dependency tracker

ask all our squads which other squads they depend on, and to what extent those dependencies are blocking or slowing the squad down. 

Understand that not all dependencies are bad, only when they introduce significant delays and/or are too unpredictable and/or increase work in progress (WIP) for the team that has to wait.
